# Credible Arrangements
This is a website I developed for a friend's flower arrangement business. I am also providing the necessary hosting services (through my GoDaddy reseller account) and maintenance. I set up the website with cPanel Hosting and Filezilla FTP, so that anyone who has FTP access can edit/upload changes to the live site from their local computer. 

## Architecture and Design
I used bootstrap's creative template because I liked its default portfolio section, which I was able to edit and build on to. The client supplied the images and the testimonials, but left the design of the site largely up to me. My overall process of designing this website involved me playing around with different colors, images (as well as editing images), fonts, font-awesome icons, layouts/placements, etc. and sending each version over to the client for feedback/approval. The website has been diligently tweaked/formatted, so that it is responsive for all screen sizes. As of me writing this, this is the project that required the most amount of time (due to constant tweaking of the content and layout), and it is the work I am most proud of. Developing this website gave me experience in developing/designing a professional website, and is my first foray into web hosting and using FTP. 

## Additional features
The testimonials section uses a jQuery slide plugin, which allows users to scroll through the reviews without having to display them all at once.

## Note
I cloned this from my original repository "credible-arrangements", but have added all of the new content/updates to this repository. To see previous commits, visit my credible-arrangements repository.
